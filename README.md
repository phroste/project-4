https://github.com/phroste/rails_pets_app

**Final Project Proposal**
https://github.com/phroste/project-4

### The name of your app
Rails Recipes/React Recipes

### MVP
Have 10-12 recipes already pre-populated in my database

Full CRUD

A user will be able to: 

1. Create and post a new recipe
2. Read/get a recipe 
3. Update an existing recipe
4. Delete an existing recipe

### Reach Goals
* Having user sign-up/login incorporating Rails authentication
* Having an input field that queries the database and returns recipes by name/category (fish, pasta, etc).
* A logged in user being able to favorite/like a recipe 
* A logged in user being able to have a personalized list of recipes

### User Stories
* As a user, I want to be able to create, read, update, and delete recipes from my list of recipes.
* As a user, I want to be able to enter links to recipe photos and have them displayed in my list of recipes.
* As a user, I want to potentially be able to log in to my account and see my personalized list of recipes.
* As a user, I want to potentially be able to log in to my account and see my edited recipes. 
* As a user, I want to potentially be able to like/favorite a recipe.
